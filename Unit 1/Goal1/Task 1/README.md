# Task 1 Concepts

** The Data Science Process**
1.Frame the problem 
2.Collect the raw data needed to solve the problem 
3.Process the data (data wrangling) 
4.Explore the data 
5.Perform in-depth analysis (machine learning, statistical models, algorithms) 
6.Communicate results of the analysis

**History of Machine Learning **

..Machine Learning is a sub-set of artificial intelligence where computer algorithms are used to autonomously learn from data and information. 
..In machine learning computers don’t have to be explicitly programmed but can change and improve their algorithms by themselves. 

1.1950- Alan Turing published an article the question, "Can Machine Think?". 
2.1957- FrankRosenblatt designed the first netural network for computers now commanly called the Perceptron Model. 
3.1959- Bernard Widrow and Marcian Hoff created two neural network models called Adeline and Madeline. 
4.1967- The "Nearest Neighbor" algorithm was written, that later allowed computers to use vary basic pattern recognization 
5.1981- Gerald Dejong intoduced concept of explanation based learning
6.2006- Geoffrey Hinton coins the term “deep learning” to explain new algorithms that let computers “see” and distinguish objects and text in images and videos. 
7.2011- IBM’s Watson beats its human competitors at Jeopardy. 
8.2011- Google Brain is developed, and its deep neural network can learn to discover and categorize objects much the way a cat does. 
9.2012- Google’s X Lab develops a machine learning algorithm that is able to autonomously browse YouTube videos to identify the videos that contain cats. 
10.2014- Facebook develops DeepFace, a software algorithm that is able to recognize or verify individuals on photos to the same level as humans can. 
11.2015- Amazon launches its own machine learning platform. 
12.2015- Microsoft creates the Distributed Machine Learning Toolkit, which enables the efficient distribution of machine learning problems across multiple computers. 
13.2015- Over 3,000 AI and Robotics researchers, endorsed by Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak (among many others), sign an open letter warning of the danger of autonomous weapons which select and engage targets without human intervention. 
14.2016- Google’s artificial intelligence algorithm beats a professional player at the Chinese board game Go, which is considered the world’s most complex board game and is many times harder than chess. The AlphaGo algorithm developed by Google DeepMind managed to win five games out of five in the Go competition.
