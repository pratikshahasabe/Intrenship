In goal one, I learn the basic and advanced concepts of python.
And also learn its important libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib,
Seaborn. After all of these, I move to learn machine learning basics concepts
And its types like supervised and unsupervised machine learning.
For the implementation of all these concepts, I use Jupiter notebook. I upload all this 
Files in Task 1 folder.
