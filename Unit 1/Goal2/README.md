In goal two I comprehend the flask. It is a microframework of Python and it's generally
Use for web development. 
For using my knowledge I developed a simple flask app. This app is uploaded in goal 
2 folder. To built-in this flask app, I use Visual Studio Code. 
It is a freeware source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
Later, I learn to test the flask app.
